# Hand Gesture Recognition Model using Convolutional Neural Networks

## Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a hand gesture recognition model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with TensorFlow and Keras. The model is designed to effectively classify images of hand gestures, making it suitable for various applications in human-computer interaction and gesture-based controls.

## Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Implemented data preprocessing techniques, including image augmentation and normalization, using TensorFlow's `ImageDataGenerator` to enhance model performance.
- **Model Training:** Trained the CNN on a structured dataset with efficient loading and validation processes to ensure robust model accuracy.
- **Prediction Functionality:** Developed a function that predicts hand gestures from new images, displaying the predicted gesture alongside the input image using Matplotlib.

## Skills Utilized
- **TensorFlow & Keras:** Leveraged deep learning frameworks to build and train CNN architectures.
- **Image Processing:** Applied best practices in data preprocessing and augmentation to improve model generalization.
